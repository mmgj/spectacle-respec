# Spectacle

This is a standalone app inspired by the official [Sanity Vision plugin](https://www.sanity.io/plugins/vision) that you can run locally to query any project/dataset (assuming you know which localhost ports are allowed to query the project).

- [@sanity/ui](https://github.com/sanity-io/ui) and [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
